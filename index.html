        <h2>Overview of SMSF Property Investments</h2>
        <p>Since the introduction of Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangements (LRBAs) in 2007, SMSFs have enabled Australians to leverage superannuation for property purchases. This allows for tax-efficient growth through rental yields and capital appreciation, all while adhering to strict superannuation regulations.</p>
        <p>Key advantages include concessional tax rates on income (15%) and reduced capital gains tax (one-third discount after 12 months, effective 10% rate in pension phase).</p>

    <section id="buying-selling">
        <h2>Buying and Selling Property via SMSF</h2>
        <p><strong>Buying:</strong> Ensure the property aligns with your SMSF's investment strategy. Use an LRBA for borrowing, involving a bare trust to hold the asset during the loan term.</p>
        <p><strong>Selling:</strong> Handle capital gains within the fund, potentially triggering tax events. Compliance with arm's length rules is crucial.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-purchase: Due diligence on title, zoning, and SMSF compliance.</li>
            <li>During transaction: Manage stamp duty, GST (if applicable), and contract execution by SMSF trustee.</li>
            <li>Post-transaction: Update investment registers and financial statements.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="compliance">
        <h2>Compliance Essentials for SMSF Property</h2>
        <p>SMSFs must comply with SIS Act requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sole purpose test: Investments solely for retirement benefits.</li>
            <li>Arm's length transactions: All dealings at market value.</li>
            <li>Prohibited acquisitions: No residential property from related parties.</li>
            <li>LRBA specifics: Single acquirable asset, limited recourse loan.</li>
            <li>Audit and reporting: Annual audits by approved auditors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non-compliance can lead to penalties up to 45% tax on benefits or fund disqualification.</p>
